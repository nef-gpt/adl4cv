  % Discussion of problem definition:
  The absence of a clear structure (eg. grid) of implicit neural fields (NeF) makes it difficult to 
  apply generative modeling directly to synthesize new data.
  % Proposed solution:
  To this end, we propose a novel approach for generating MLP-weights of neural 
  fields in an autoregressive transformer-based fashion.
  % Expected outcome:
  Our approach is expected to unconditionally and autoregressively generate the MLP-weights of a 
  novel NeF
