  % Discussion of problem definition:
  The absence of a clear structure of implicit neural fields (NeF) makes it difficult to
  apply generative modeling directly to synthesize new data.
  % Proposed solution:
  To this end, we propose a novel approach for generating Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)-weights of neural
  fields in an autoregressive transformer-based fashion.
  % Expected outcome:
  Our approach is expected to unconditionally generate the MLP-weights of
  novel neural fields.
