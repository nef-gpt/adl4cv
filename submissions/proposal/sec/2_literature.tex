% In \cite{erko√ß2023hyperdiffusion} it was shown that HyperDiffusion can be
% used to generate novel MLP-weights for NeF. Furthermore in \cite{siddiqui2023meshgpt} a autoregressive transformer-based approach
% was used for the generation of novel 3D structure. For our approach we want to use a similar approach
% as in \cite{siddiqui2023meshgpt} on a different domain. Instead of predicting the next most-likely triangle mesh we want to
% predict the next most-likely MLP-weight.

% this is also very good [https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12780]
