\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% eleborate on motivation
In recent years we have seen an astonishing success in neural field models as well as in autoregressive 
transformer-based generative models.
% and problem statement
In our work we want to demonstrate that even though the MLP-weights do not follow an appearent
structure, novel neural field can be generated by using transformers to
predict the most-likely weights of the MLP.
% contribution bullet points
Our contribution are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item provide a positional encoding or weight embedding that can be used to generate novel neural fields


\end{itemize}
