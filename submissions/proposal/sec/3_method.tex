\section{Proposed Methods}
\label{sec:method}

Train nanoGPT to generate the MLP-weights in an autoregressive, unconditioned fashion.

\subsection{Graph-based Embedding}
-learn a vocabulary of latent embeddings - using some kind of neighborhood encoding
-train an autoencoder to find an embedding that maps from an unstructured representation
to a structured latent space by providing structure through neighborhood encoding

\subsection{Graph-based Positional Encoding}
-use positional encoding to provide positional information
