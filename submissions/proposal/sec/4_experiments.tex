% Potential Baselines
As a baseline we want to use unconditional image generators based on HyperDiffusion?
% Datasets
The data of \cite{papa2023train} is used. This dataset contains overfitted NeF overfitted using the
MNIST, CIFAR10, MicroImageNet and ShapeNet dataset. All of these NeF are SIREN NeF.
% Metrics
In HyperDiffusion Minimum Matching Distance (MMD), Coverage (COV), and 1-Nearest-Neighbor Accuracy (1-NNA) is
used. So maybe the same?
