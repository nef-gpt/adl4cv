% Datasets
\subsection*{Data}\\
The experiments leverage the dataset introduced by \cite{papa2023train}, which contains neural radiance fields overfitted on the SIREN architecture using the MNIST, CIFAR10, MicroImageNet and ShapeNet datasets. This allows for evaluation on both 2D image data as well as 3D shape representations. \\
% Metrics
\subsection*{Metrics and Baselines}\\
Evaluating the quality of synthesized neural fields poses challenges due to the lack of ground truth data. We adopt the metrics proposed by \cite{erko√ß2023hyperdiffusion}, specifically the Minimum Matching Distance (MMD), Coverage (COV), and 1-Nearest-Neighbor Accuracy (1-NNA), to facilitate comparisons with the seminal works that inspired this research and serve as performance baselines. \\
