  % Discussion of problem definition:
  The absence of a clear structure of implicit neural fields (NeF) makes it difficult to
  apply generative modeling directly to synthesize new data. On the other hand they have shown a remarkable success in compressed scene representation.
  % Proposed solution:
  To this end, we propose a novel approach for generating Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)-weights of neural
  fields in an autoregressive transformer-based fashion.
  % Experimental outcome
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the MNIST dataset as well as 3D meshes from shapenet and evaluate it against results of state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.
