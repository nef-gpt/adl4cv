\section{Limitations and further research}

While NeF-GPT achieves, to our knowledge, the first autoregressive generation of neural field weights directly, some limitations remain. Firstly, the transformer is trained solely on the MLP-weight sequence, without any indication of how well the reconstruction resembles the original surface area. This could be improved by incorporating a secondary loss function that provides additional information in the image space. Additionally, conditioning the initial weights may hinder the learning of the neural fields by enforcing a similar structure. This issue could be addressed by developing an autoencoder structure which permits a permutation invariant input.
