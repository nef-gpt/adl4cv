\section{Conclusion}

We proposed NeF-GPT, a new autoregressive generative process for neural implicit fields. This method leverages the compact representation power of neural fields to model high-dimensional surface data by directly autoregressively generating the weight space of the neural fields using a transformer-based approach.
