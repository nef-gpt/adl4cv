\section{Conclusion}

During this report we proposed NeF-GPT, a new autoregressive generative process for implicit neural fields. This method leverages the compact representation power of neural fields to model high-dimensional surface data by directly autoregressively generating tokens that represent the weight space of the neural fields using a decoder only transformer-based approach.
